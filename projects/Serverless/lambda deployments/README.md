# Lambda Deployments

This repository have the focus on showing how you can easily build your lambdas with terraform into 3 levels

1. single file -> you don't need nothing else than aws packages and python standars
2. layers -> if you need more libs more they don't except 250 mb
3. docker container -> robust applications that can easily be transformed into a serverfull app if the lambda computational limits doesn't support you anymore
